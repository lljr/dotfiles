* Getting Started
These are my configuration files.
For now, there is only a file that configurates Emacs in ~/emacs/config.org~.

Since the configuration is in an Org Mode file, run ~M-x org-babel-tangle~ when visiting the file.
This command, or function, will paste all the code blocks to ~init.el~, the file Emacs reads to change its configuration.

~org-babel-tangle~ binds to ~C-c C-v C-t~. The previous keychord may be used to instead of ~org-babel-tangle~.
